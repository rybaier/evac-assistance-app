# Evac Assistance App - Evacced or Evact? working title? Evaxapp or EvacPrapp or Evac Assist
## What is this 
An Evacuation Assistance App to help individuals, families and friends reduce the stress and have a plan to follow when the need to evacuate their home arises.

## The Idea 
Things The app will do
- Store an Evac Grab list
    - list of items to grab ordered by importance and evacuation status
    - Have prep steps for each evacuation zone level 1-3

- Have a Group of users that individual users can join  
   - Use Location Sharing displayed on the map for user group
       - have traffic data loaded from google maps 
       - so users can find others in the group to meetup if evac called when users are separate
       - Have meeting places in each of the 4 cardinal directions so depending on traffic and where evac 
       emergency is there is a designated place to meet and gather user group
    - S.O.S. Beacon button to notify user group that individual user is in immediate danger/ needs assistance
    - Have 2way radio functionality (not sure if this is possible it is a SUPER STRECH GOAL for the timeframe)
        - operates like CB radio giving users ability to communicate if cell towers go down
        - can send recorded messages 
        - can talk real-time like CB radio
        
- Has Evac Prep steps for things to do as an initial phase of preparation
    - take photos of important items in house
    - take photos of important documents 
        - (deed for the house, licenses, passports, birth certs. etc)
    - how to build a go-bag of necessary items 
    - safe deposit box or safe recommendation?

- access to local scanner Radio by county and city
