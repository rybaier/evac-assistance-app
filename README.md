# Evac Assistance App - Evacced or Evact? working title? Evaxapp or EvacPrapp or Evac Assist
## What is this 
An Evacuation Assistance App to help individuals, families and friends reduce the stress and have a plan to follow when the need to evacuate their home arises.

## The Idea 
Things The app will do
- Store an Evac Grab list
    - list of items to grab ordered by importance and evacuation status
    - Have prep steps for each evacuation zone level 1-3

- Have a Group of users that individual users can join  
   - Use Location Sharing displayed on the map for user group
       - have traffic data loaded from google maps 
       - so users can find others in the group to meetup if evac called when users are separate
       - Have meeting places in each of the 4 cardinal directions so depending on traffic and where evac 
       emergency is there is a designated place to meet and gather user group
    - S.O.S. Beacon button to notify user group that individual user is in immediate danger/ needs assistance
    - Have 2way radio functionality (not sure if this is possible it is a SUPER STRECH GOAL for the timeframe)
        - operates like CB radio giving users ability to communicate if cell towers go down
        - can send recorded messages 
        - can talk real-time like CB radio
        
- Has Evac Prep steps for things to do as an initial phase of preparation
    - take photos of important items in house
    - take photos of important documents 
        - (deed for the house, licenses, passports, birth certs. etc)
    - how to build a go-bag of necessary items 
    - safe deposit box or safe recommendation?

- access to local scanner Radio by county and city
## Why I am building this
- First being evacuated from your home is wild emotional ride, it is challenging, and happens so fast.

- This started out as an idea for my capstone project for General Assembly, I really wanted to build something that would be useful for the public. I also wanted to have something that I could continue to work on after the course and keep improving and building it. 

- I got my wish, from my wireframe mockups and designing I became focused on how to have an app that could be helpful before, during, and after the evacuation process. I had a huge case of SCOPE CREEP. However, I have something to work on for a while and once I achieve the full functionality, of all features which is waiting for approval from specific data structures,(access to local scanner streaming from Broadcastify being a huge blocker currently)

- At the core this app is designed to have a prepared plan if you are forced to evacuate your home. This consists of deciding what to take, and where to go when it happens. Trying to do this in the heat of the moment, makes it possible to forget something important.
